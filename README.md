# Towers-of-Hanoi-Website
A simple website to implement and illustrate the towers of hanoi problem in an interesting manner
This project is an interactive visualization of the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle, designed to help users understand the recursive solution process in a fun and engaging way. The application allows users to customize the puzzle by selecting the number of disks (1â€“10) and adjusting the animation speed to their preference. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a responsive layout with a clean and colorful design. Users can start the game with a single click, and the algorithm automatically solves the puzzle while animating each move step-by-step. The logic is implemented using recursion to calculate the optimal sequence of moves, and the disks are dynamically styled and animated for clarity. The project is easy to use, visually appealing, and provides an excellent introduction to recursion and problem-solving. Future enhancements could include a step-by-step mode, statistics display, or additional user-interactive features to deepen engagement. To get started, simply clone the repository, open index.html in your browser, and explore the logic behind the Towers of Hano
